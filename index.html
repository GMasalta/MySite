                    Hey There! My Name is Geraline Masalta, but you can call me Rarah for short. I am in the Second semester of my Third Year Studying Computer Science at Palawan State University. I'd like to tell a little bit about my Background and Interests.

                    I have my own two pets which I considered as my kid. I named them Wol and Groot. Some of my everyday activities included Reading, Sketching, Watching Movies, Listening to music ( My Favourite song Right Now: NVMD by Denise Julia), Helping People, Playing Games with Friends, and Sleep.
